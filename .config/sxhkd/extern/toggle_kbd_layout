# Very simple way to switch keyboard layouts between US QWERTY and
# standard Greek.  This script is assigned to a key chord in my
# `sxkdrc`.  A variant of this is also included in my system panel, the
# `melonpanel` to get the current layout. Everything is part of my
# dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.
