# EXPERIMENTAL 2019-11-30: It works after connecting a monitor to the
# laptop, but not when disconnecting.  The problem seems to be with
# BSPWM, since `bspc query -M' continues to list the second monitorâ€¦
# Will investigate further.

# Run this after {dis,}connecting an external monitor.  It will
# recognifure the layout, based on the functions provided in the scripts
# it calls.

_check() {
    command -v "$1" > /dev/null
}

# In case the Hyper key ever stops working, we can call this script
# (Ctrl+Alt+Delete on my sxhkdrc) and apply the modifications again.
